# 交/并/差/集查询

> 两张表

1. per1

2. per2

## 交集

```mysql
SELECT
	per1.* 
FROM
	per1 INNER JOIN per2 
ON per1.NAME = per2.NAME AND per1.id = per2.id
```

![](https://gitee.com/sxhDrk/images/raw/master/imgs/20210427111440.png)

> `USING(id,name)`等价于`per1.id=per2.id and per1.name = per2.name`

```mysql
SELECT
	per1.* 
FROM
	per1 INNER JOIN per2 
USING(id,name)
```

## 并集

### 不去重

```mysql
select name from per1
union all
select name from per2
```

### 去重

```mysql
select name from per1
union
select name from per2
```

## 差集

> 可以通过左/右连接查询

```mysql
SELECT
	per1.* 
FROM
	per1 left JOIN per2 
USING(id,name)
where per2.id is null
```

# 左/右/内/连接

> 两张表

1. student表（学生）

   ![image-20210302164228324](https://gitee.com/sxhDrk/images/raw/master/imgs/20210427111444.png)

## 内连接

## 左连接

```mysql
SELECT
	 student.name,
	 student.gender,
	 course.course_name,
	 student.score
FROM
	student
	left JOIN 
	course 
ON student.id = course.id
ORDER BY student.name
```

> 查询结果

## 右连接

```mysql
SELECT
	 student.name,
	 student.gender,
	 course.course_name,
	 student.score
FROM
	student
	right JOIN 
	course 
ON student.id = course.id
ORDER BY student.name

```

## 行转列

> case方式

```mysql
SELECT 
	name,
	sum( CASE WHEN id = 1 THEN score END ) AS '数学',
	sum( CASE WHEN id = 2 THEN score END ) AS '语文',
	sum( CASE WHEN id = 3 THEN score END ) AS '英语'
FROM
	student 
GROUP BY student.name
```

> case else方式
>
> 可以将上面null的值变成0

```mysql
SELECT 
	name,
	sum( CASE WHEN id = 1 THEN score else 0 END ) AS '数学',
	sum( CASE WHEN id = 2 THEN score else 0 END ) AS '语文',
	sum( CASE WHEN id = 3 THEN score else 0 END ) AS '英语'
FROM
	student 
GROUP BY student.name
```

![image-20210302173018594](https://gitee.com/sxhDrk/images/raw/master/imgs/20210427111450.png)

> if 方式

```mysql

SELECT 
	name,
	sum(if(id=1,score,0)) AS '数学',
	sum(if(id=2,score,0)) AS '语文',
	sum(if(id=3,score,0)) AS '英语'
FROM
	student 
GROUP BY student.name
```

![image-20210302173018594](https://gitee.com/sxhDrk/images/raw/master/imgs/20210427111450.png)

> select方式

```mysql
select 
	name,
	gender,
	(select score from student where name=s.name and id=1) as '数学',
	(select score from student where name=s.name and id=2) as '语文',
	(select score from student where name=s.name and id=3) as '英语'
from student s 
```

> group分组字段的基础上再进行求和

```mysql
SELECT 
	ifnull(name,'total') as name,
	sum(if(id=1,score,0)) AS '数学',
	sum(if(id=2,score,0)) AS '语文',
	sum(if(id=3,score,0)) AS '英语'
FROM
	student 
GROUP BY student.name with ROLLUP
```

![image-20210302173604865](https://gitee.com/sxhDrk/images/raw/master/imgs/20210427111452.png)

> 通过两次group by和with rollup进行分类汇总

```mysql
SELECT 
	ifnull(name,'total') as name,
	sum(if(id=1,score,0)) AS '数学',
	sum(if(id=2,score,0)) AS '语文',
	sum(if(id=3,score,0)) AS '英语',
	sum(if(id=0,score,0)) AS total
FROM
	(
		select 
			name,
			IFNULL(id,0) as 'id',
			sum(score) as score
		from student
		GROUP BY name,id
		with ROLLUP
		HAVING name is not null
	) as A
GROUP BY A.name 
with ROLLUP

```
